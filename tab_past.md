Basics of SQL injection

UNM Centennial Library, DEN2

UNM student Franklin Pezzuti Dyer will discuss the basics of how databases might be used for web applications, how a web app can manipulate a database using SQL, and how this can leave an app open for attack if SQL commands are handled unsafely. The meeting will consist of a short introductory talk, followed by a lab session consisting of SQL injection exercises on deliberately vulnerable websites hosted by Portswigger.

If you would like to participate in the lab session, please come prepared with a Portswigger account, and a proxy of your choice installed. You will need this to capture, examine and modify HTTP packets. You could use Burp Suite (software by Portswigger, recommended) or an open-source alternative like mitmproxy.

Our space is limited to 16 people, so please RSVP to fpezzutidyer@unm.edu.

Agenda: 

- Say Howdy
- Featured presentation "Basics of SQL injection"
- Pitch ideas and recruit volunteers for future presentations
