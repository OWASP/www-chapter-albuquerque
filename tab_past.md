## Cross-Site Request Forgery Basics

Tuesday, April 30, 2024, at 5:30 pm

<a href='https://www.google.com/maps?ll=35.065797,-106.564822&z=16&t=m&hl=en-US&gl=US&mapclient=embed&cid=1931813735759550125' target='_blank'>Cesar Chavez Community Center</a>, Meeting Room

Franklin and Althea will discuss <a href='/www-chapter-albuquerque/assets/pdf/csrf-handout.pdf' target='_blank'>the basics of Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)</a>, assuming as little knowledge of web development as possible. This will include a review of how web browsers load and render web pages by making HTTP requests to a web server, how cookies are used to authenticate requests, and how authenticated requests are spoofed in a CSRF attack. They will also discuss browser security mechanisms that facilitate CSRF prevention, and what a website designer can do to prevent these attacks. The talk will be followed by a lab exercise from Portswigger.

Please RSVP to franklin.dyer@owasp.org. If you want to participate in the lab exercise, please bring a personal computer and make an account on the Portswigger website before the event. It is also recommended (but not required) to install either Burp Suite Community Edition, or another web proxy of your choice.

### Agenda: 
- Meet and greet
- Featured presentation "Cross-Site Request Forgery Basics"
- Elect 2 co-leaders for next year
- Pitch ideas and recruit volunteers for future presentations

## Basics of SQL injection

Monday, November 27, 2023, at 4 pm

UNM Centennial Library, DEN2

UNM student Franklin Pezzuti Dyer will discuss the basics of how databases might be used for web applications, how a web app can manipulate a database using SQL, and how this can leave an app open for attack if SQL commands are handled unsafely. The meeting will consist of a short introductory talk, followed by a lab session consisting of SQL injection exercises on deliberately vulnerable websites hosted by Portswigger.

If you would like to participate in the lab session, please come prepared with a Portswigger account, and a proxy of your choice installed. You will need this to capture, examine and modify HTTP packets. You could use Burp Suite (software by Portswigger, recommended) or an open-source alternative like mitmproxy.

Our space is limited to 16 people, so please RSVP to fpezzutidyer@unm.edu.

### Agenda: 

- Say Howdy
- Featured presentation "Basics of SQL injection"
