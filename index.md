## Welcome
OWASP Albuquerque is for anyone here in town to discuss software security topics. We have a couple discussion ideas in mind, but we are also eager to hear what you would like to talk about too!

## Upcoming Event: Albuquerque Software Social Club

**Monthly on Thursday, at 6:00 pm**

The Albuquerque Software Social Club meets at O'Neills once a month for tech presentations. This is not an OWASP event, but you are sure to find something interesting at the next tech presentation. Go to their <a href="https://www.meetup.com/albuquerque-software-social-club/" target="new">Meetup page</a> to find out more.
