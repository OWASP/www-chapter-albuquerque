Fuzzing is a technique to test programs with generated data. Its main goal is to detect crashes and non-expected failures. Radamsa is a general-purpose, black-box-oriented mutating fuzzer. In this talk, Jos√© will show examples of fuzzing using radamsa from basic command line tools to network services. We will also discuss some applications in cybersecurity of fuzzing involving automation of test cases.
