## Welcome
OWASP Albuquerque is for anyone here in town to discuss software security topics. We have a couple discussion ideas in mind, but we are also eager to hear what you would like to talk about too!

## Next Event: Code Eyeballing

**Wednesday, March 27, 2023, at 4 pm**

<a href="/www-chapter-albuquerque/#div-centlibrary" onclick="location.hash='div-centlibrary'; location.reload();">UNM Centennial Library</a>, DEN2

Rose will guide us through a code review of a simple web application. Participants will be invited to eyeball code in the context of their favorite risk from OWASP Top 10; list issues; discuss remediation strategies; and prioritize remediations. 

All activities can be completed by looking at code. But you can also test on your machine with Docker: deploy https://github.com/pzzd/docker-lamp and send a request to rose.dyer@owasp.org for access to the web application repo.

Our space is limited to 16 people, so please RSVP to fpezzutidyer@unm.edu.

### Agenda: 
- Greetings and salutations
