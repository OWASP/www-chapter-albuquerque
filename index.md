## Welcome
OWASP Albuquerque is for anyone here in town to discuss software security topics. We have a couple discussion ideas in mind, but we are also eager to hear what you would like to talk about too!

## Next Event: Basics of SQL injection

**Monday, November 27, 2023, at 4 pm**

<a href="/www-chapter-albuquerque/#div-centlibrary" onclick="location.hash='div-centlibrary'; location.reload();">UNM Centennial Library</a>, DEN2

UNM student Franklin Pezzuti Dyer will discuss the basics of how databases might be used for web applications, how a web app can manipulate a database using SQL, and how this can leave an app open for attack if SQL commands are handled unsafely. The meeting will consist of a short introductory talk, followed by a lab session consisting of SQL injection exercises on deliberately vulnerable websites hosted by Portswigger.

If you would like to participate in the lab session, please come prepared with a Portswigger account, and a proxy of your choice installed. You will need this to capture, examine and modify HTTP packets. You could use Burp Suite (software by Portswigger, recommended) or an open-source alternative like mitmproxy.

Our space is limited to 16 people, so please RSVP to fpezzutidyer@unm.edu.
