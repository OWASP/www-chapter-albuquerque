## Welcome
OWASP Albuquerque is for anyone here in town to discuss software security topics. We have a couple discussion ideas in mind, but we are also eager to hear what you would like to talk about too!

## Next Event: Cross-Site Request Forgery Basics

**Tuesday, April 30, 2024, at 5:30 pm**

<a href='https://www.google.com/maps?ll=35.065797,-106.564822&z=16&t=m&hl=en-US&gl=US&mapclient=embed&cid=1931813735759550125' target='_blank'>Cesar Chavez Community Center</a>, Meeting Room

Franklin and Althea will discuss the basics of Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF), assuming as little knowledge of web development as possible. This will include a review of how web browsers load and render web pages by making HTTP requests to a web server, how cookies are used to authenticate requests, and how authenticated requests are spoofed in a CSRF attack. They will also discuss browser security mechanisms that facilitate CSRF prevention, and what a website designer can do to prevent these attacks. The talk will be followed by a lab exercise from Portswigger.

Please RSVP to franklin.dyer@owasp.org. If you want to participate in the lab exercise, please bring a personal computer and make an account on the Portswigger website before the event. It is also recommended (but not required) to install either Burp Suite Community Edition, or another web proxy of your choice.
